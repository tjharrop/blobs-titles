    <h2>Iâ€™m TJ Harrop, a design manager, agile coach, and born-again coder. I specialise in design systems and design technology.</h2>
    <p><strong>Design Systems</strong> is about providing tools for designers and developers to make things technically better, better for users, and more efficient.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Technologists</strong> merge engineering and design processes. Technology and creativity together result in scalability, systematic quality, and productivity for product teams. <a href="https://medium.com/interactive-mind/the-rise-of-the-design-technologist-e9516aa821a0">My desTech intro in <em>Interactive Mind</em> (2015)</a></p>

    <h1 class="editor-indicator-text">Why people hire me</h1>
    <p>People hire me when they already understand the benefits of well designed products and services, but want a more robust way to make sure their outputs meet those standards in an efficient way.</p>
    <p>I work with companies to design, build, and adopt style guides, component libraries, design systems, UI platforms, and opeating models.</p>
    <p>My favourite approach to work is getting my hands dirty alongside designers and developers, which is why I also keep my coding and interaction design skills current, but I'm not the guy you hire just to write code or make wireframes.</p>

    <h1 class="editor-indicator-text">Projects &amp; roles</h1>
    <p>I've been working with digital products since 2002. My goal is to make better products and services. In 2002 I did this by designing and building them, now I help large teams do the same.</p>
    <p>My past work includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IAG, Design System</strong> <em>Increasing scalability, opeationalisation, and user-needs focus of a 30+ multi-brand design system</em></li>
      <li><strong>NSW Gov, Design System</strong> <em>Transforming the successful UI/UX component library in to a Dsign System &amp; DesignOps practice (current)</em></li>
      <li><strong>Canadian Gov, Rules as Code</strong> <em>Advising teams working on Canada's first foray in to Rules as Code</em></li>
      <li><strong>NSW Gov, Rules as Code</strong> <em>Leading the product and tech work to roll out RaC in NSW</em></li>
      <li><strong>EY-Seren</strong> <em>Embedding design &amp; build in to a globally distributed innovation consultancy service</em></li>
      <li><strong>Jaguar Land Rover</strong> <em>Introducing digital product design processes to infotainment engineering teams</em></li>
      <li><strong>The Home Office (UK Gov)</strong> <em>Creating tools to feed a design-the-code culture &amp; a skills-based design resourcing process</em></li>
      <li><strong>Sky TV</strong> <em>Making an easier dev/design handoff process which also embeds common design language into products</em></li>
      <li><strong>Basic Key</strong> <em>Basic key was my first paid client in 2002. I was 15 and made their website, and they deserve an honourable mention.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Good design, UX, and UI development is valued and respected by organisations, the new challenge is how they become an integrated part of everyday operations.</h2>
    <p>I can help refactor your design system, design practice, or UI development approach to be better integrated, more productive, and to have robust quaity.</p>
    <p>In 2017, an organisation in Sydney told me they had the biggest UX team in the southern hemisphere as a kind of brag. Don't be like them - <a href="#contact">contact me about adopting &amp; improving design and UI development</a>.</p>
