    <h2>Iâ€™m TJ Harrop, a design manager, agile coach, and born-again coder. I specialise in design operations and design technology.</h2>
    <p><strong>Design Operations</strong> is the work to scale the design practice in an Organisation. The goal of DesignOps is to handle all work that can be packaged for designers, so that they can spend their time working on what matters - designing products and services.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Technologists</strong> merge engineering and design processes. Technology and creativity together result in scalability, systematic quality, and productivity for design teams. <a href="https://medium.com/interactive-mind/the-rise-of-the-design-technologist-e9516aa821a0">My desTech intro in <em>Interactive Mind</em> (2015)</a></p>

    <h1 class="editor-indicator-text">Why people hire me</h1>
    <p>People hire me when they already understand the benefits of well designed products and services, and want to cost-effectively mature their design practice to be manageable, with assured outputs.</p>
    <p>When a design grows from something within a workstream, or an 'internal agency' team, to a distributed enterprise practice, the processes, tools, and governance need to be re-engineered. The distribution of design skills also needs to be carefully balanced. Scaling design without creating expensive inefficiencies can be boiled down to 3 tightly-coupled topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Design in your org.</strong><em> Community, Recruitment, L&amp;D, Retention</em></li>
      <li><strong>Supporting designers.</strong><em> Agile practices, Research sharing, Design Systems &amp; tools</em></li>
      <li><strong>Collectively owning 'good'.</strong><em> Platforms to share and refine skills, tools, patterns, or ideas.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1 class="editor-indicator-text">Projects &amp; roles</h1>
    <p>I've been working in design (mostly within digital / UX) since 2003. The goal, since the beginning, was to make better products and services. Now, I am less focussed on making a thing, and concentrate on the strategic, systemic, and operational changes needed for others to make good things.</p>
    <p>My past DesignOps work includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NSW Gov, Design System</strong> <em>Transforming the successful UI/UX design system in to a DesignOps practice (current)</em></li>
      <li><strong>Canadian Gov, Rules as Code</strong> <em>Advising teams working on Canada's first foray in to Rules as Code</em></li>
      <li><strong>NSW Gov, Rules as Code</strong> <em>Leading the product and tech work to roll out RaC in NSW</em></li>
      <li><strong>EY-Seren</strong> <em>Embeddind tech &amp; design in to a globally distributed lean startup consultancy service</em></li>
      <li><strong>Jaguar Land Rover</strong> <em>Introducing digital product design processes to infotainment engineering teams</em></li>
      <li><strong>The Home Office (UK Gov)</strong> <em>Creating tools to feed a design-the-code culture &amp; a skills-based design resourcing process</em></li>
      <li><strong>Sky TV</strong> <em>Making an easier dev/design handoff process which also embeds common design language into products</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design has growing pains. Now that the practice is valued and respected, the new challenge is how it becomes an integrated part of everyday operations.</h2>
    <p>As an independent consultant, I can help you refactor your design practice without the overheads of a full-time hire. The outcome is a design practice with quality assurance baked-in, is better integrated, and more productive.</p>
    <p>In 2017, an organisation in Sydney told me they had the biggest UI/UX team in the southern hemisphere, which in their eyes meant success and maturity. Don't be like them. <a href="#contact">Let's work together to make design work better</a>.</p>
